# PythonBot
This project is a side project I've been working on during the last few weeks
It's a bot that allows me automate tedious tasks in a game using Python and the Keyboard & pyautogui modules
The manage.py file is the brain of the code where I can import everything and run it from there. The second biggest file, mountTrainer.py contains the biggest part of the project
containing the code to fully train mounts to later sell them. It's adapted to my screen and checks for certain pixels, making it obselete for different aspect ratios and size
